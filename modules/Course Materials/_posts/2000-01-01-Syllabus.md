- Review of the concepts of scale, projections, datums, EPSG codes, and PROJ syntax
- Maintaining/cleaning spreadsheets

Homework: Capture a set of georeferenced satellite images (projected) at a set of scales, 1:20K and 1:5K. Track the coordinates of the corners.

## **Day 2: Integration of site-specific data (Lecturer: Pietro Calogero)**

9:00 am – 12:00 pm Lecture

1:00 pm – 2:00 pm Lab

- Digitization: freehand, ortho, ortho-rotated, and respecting the limitations of image-resolution
- Integrating site-survey data and sat-photo data into vector layers
- Creating new layers: thinking through Attribute design
- Creating dropdowns in attribute table. Relational databases and character encoding issues
- Time series of images: the History function in Google Earth; satphoto dates; other sources
- Periodization trends: personal photos that show change since last sat-photo; annotation of layers

Skills: digitization (review); attribute table design, creation, and editing (review); search/filter in attribute table; integration of research data 

Homework: Create a set of images both from above and from the ground that show change to a site.

## **Day 3: Evaluating threats to cultural heritage along the TAPI Pipeline in remotely sensed imagery (Lecturer: Jennifer Feng)**

9:00 am – 11:00 am Lecture

12:00 pm – 3:00 pm Lab

[Lecture Summary and Exercises](https://camel-lab-oi.github.io/AHMPWorkshop2020/pdfs/Day3_SiteAssessments_TAPI.pdf)

- Look at existing Attribute Table critically
- Identifying sites based on this data
- Visual assessment of threats to sites—roads, infrastructure, erosion, looting, agricultural expansion



Skills: site identification, analyzing time series imagery, assessing threats to cultural heritage in satellite imagery

Homework: Create one or several layers identifying at least 20 sites, with a preliminary assessment of threats and other issues.

## **Day 4: Hydrology (Lecturer: Tony Lauricella)**

9:00 am – 12:00 pm Lecture

1:00 pm – 3:00 pm Lab

- Obtaining DEMs (re-visit); image-processing DEMs via symbology settings; 4 types of terrain analysis with DEMs (review)
- Correlation with available hydrology layers
  - Flood risk (flow-accumulation analysis)
  - urbanization risk
  - potential-site identification

Skills: modeling water flow using GIS tools and DEM

Homework: Determine areas with high flood or erosion potential in a landscape.

## **Day 5: Predictive modeling of an urban environment (Lecturer: Andrew Wright)**

9:00 am – 11:00 am Lecture

12:00 pm – 3:00 pm Lab

- Simplified version of Gwendolyn Kristy’s research in Herat; apply to Hadda site
- Integration of historic maps for identification and evaluation (Corona, Landsat, recent)
- Using looters’ pits to (A) find sites and (B) evaluate threat

Skills: clipping, buffering, extracting slope values to vector data, use of other geoprocessing tools

Homework: Create a predictive model of urbanization around Hadda.

## **Day 6: Remote sensing of the archaeological landscape (Lecturer: Tony Lauricella)**

9:00 am – 12:00 pm Lecture

1:00 pm – 2:00 pm Lab

- Review of electromagnetic spectrum, bands of imagery (near infrared, etc.)
- Applications and visualization
  - Band combinations
- Vegetation indices (NDVI, etc.)
- Using multispectral datasets to visualize sites effectively 

Homework: NDVI analysis of area where a site is.

## **Day 7: Prioritization/triage (Lecturer: Pietro Calogero)**

9:00 am – 12:00 pm Lecture

1:00 pm – 3:00 pm Lab

- Ian McHarg overlays and identification of priority areas
- Clipping to identify high-priority areas from overlays
- Directive outcomes (prep for negotiation)
  - 100% no-interference zone; highest cultural priority
  - Buffer-zones around confirmed/probable sites concentric priority
  - Categorically distinct policy arguments:
  - Archaeological survey with full documentation before construction
  - Archaeological Survey first pre-construction
    - Reserve the right to stop construction indefinitely
    - Reserve the right to conduct a survey before construction
    
Homework: Do analysis that synthesizes work from previous days to identify areas in ranked order of sensitivity.

## **Day 8: Graphic communication and persuasion with GIS (Lecturer: Pietro Calogero)**

9:00 am – 12:00 pm Lecture

1:00 pm – 3:00 pm Lab

- Symbology: colors, lineweights, symbols, and how to store them
- Data-driven graphics: Choropleth maps
- The Layout Manager: Title, data legend, explanation, attribution, scale, North arrow
- Outputs as raster, SVG, and PDF (and their uses)
- Managing multiple layouts

Homework: Output two different maps of your working data both as raster and PDF.

## **Day 9: Professional ethics in QGIS and Afghanistan (Lecturer: Pietro Calogero)**

9:00 am – 12:00 pm Discussion

1:00 pm – 2:00 pm Lab

- Building and disseminating data on a website
- Privacy, security, and anonymity

Homework: Propose a policy tailored to your specific site.

## **Day 10: Public maps/dissemination (Lecturer: Pietro Calogero)**

9:00 am – 11:00 am Lecture

12:00 pm – 1:00 pm Lab

- Best map making procedures, Leaflet, etc.
- StoryMap JS

Homework: Make a Leaflet map.

## **Day 11: Final Project Presentations/discussion**

Time TBD

- Prepare a presentation in which you make an argument (I.e. expanding a protection area, expanding a survey, applying for grant-funding)
- Display text primarily in Dari
- Include standard map features: N arrow, Scale, Legend, Title, Source-Attribution
- Use as many of the skills learned as possible that were learned during the course
